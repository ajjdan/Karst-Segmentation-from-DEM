# Using Machine Learning to quantify the strength of weathering at carbonate rock landscapes

## Dataset

![Extent of karstified areas over Europe](./images/map_of_europe.png)

## Format of the bordering tiles dataset:

    - A subset of tiles that include non-karstified areas as well as karstified areas was created
    - Data was stored in a compressed .npz file (4.6 GB) containing 144000 images, 
		115.200 images for training and 28.800 images for testing.
    - The Data was stored in 4 seperate arrays containing testing and training input and output 
		(x_train/x_test for input and y_train/y_test for output)
    - Input data contains a 3D array with elevation, slope and surface roughness
    - output data contains a 3D binary array with replicated channels
